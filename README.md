# Grease Pencil 2D Morphs
Addon for Blender that uses Grease Pencil frames made by the user to make interpolated frames and a rig control to manipulate the frames in up to two dimensions. Could be useful for rigs with head turns, muscle bulging, automatic jiggle physics, and probably more.

The addon also comes with a custom Grease Pencil operator "Interpolate Sequence Disorderly" that does the same thing as Interpolate Sequence, but can handle interpolating between two frames whose stroke orders are different. See the video for limitations.
